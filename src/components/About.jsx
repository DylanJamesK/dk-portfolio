        These four values shape how I approach every project because they ground my work in understanding real human needs and aspirations. Whether I’m building a prototype, running a workshop, or designing an interface- I always return to these principles to guide my decisions and ensure the work connects with real people. I didn’t always know I wanted to be a designer. My path started with curiosity- constantly breaking things apart and wondering how they worked, how they looked, and how they could be better. Over time, I found that design was the bridge between creativity and problem solving.
